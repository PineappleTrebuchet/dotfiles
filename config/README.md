# Personal Dotfiles

These are the dotfiles for my daily driver! I use EndeavourOS alongside SwayWM, but these should work on any distro. Feel free to use these for inspiration or as a template for your own dotfiles.

Keep in mind that these dotfiles aren't drag-and-drop ready and that this repo is mainly for personal use. There are a couple of absolute paths that require you to manually tweak them (the background in the Sway config comes to mind).
